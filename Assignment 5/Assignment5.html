     <h2>What is Lemme Help?</h2>
     <p>Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:
     senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which
     put them at additional risk.</br> </br>
     Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary
     supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be. </br> </br>

     Helping Hands Community connects those who must shelter in place with our
     volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and essential
     supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes community
     volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive solution for
     partners to scale their own impact.</br> </br>
     Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch requests
     at scale through the Helping Hands Community platform, while we connect
     individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.</p>

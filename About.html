         <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food insecurity, using technology to
         empower community organizations and local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in
         need. </br> </br></p>
         <h2>How we help</h2>
         <p>
         Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our volunteers and delivery partners so
         groceries, medication and essential supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes<img src="Man.jpg" alt="Man">
         community volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive
         solution for partners to scale their own impact. </br> </br>

        Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch
         requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we connect
         individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.</br> </br>
         Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second
         Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer
         shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale. We've
         grown the number of people we can help by working together—and we
         are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our mission.</br> </br></br></br></p>
         <h2>Join our team</h2>
         <p>Founded by veterans of Uber, Facebook, and Google, as well as students beginning their careers, the
         Lemme Help organization comprises more than 150 volunteers around the country who want to give
         back. Together, we make local volunteerism easy and reliable for our partners and help to slow the
         national spread of COVID-19.</br> </br>
         If you are passionate about making a difference in people’s lives, we’d love to have you join our team of
         dedicated volunteers!</br> </br>
